# CHIP-8
Technically my second emulator, did one for a college project. This one is significantly more advanced if you can believe it, my college one was pretty much capable of multiplication at most, but it did teach me a lot about how computers work on a fundamental level.


Use the ./whatever -r (or --rom) [path to rom] to pick a file and go. -d or --delay lets you change the speed of emulation, and -s or --scale changes the size of the window. Run with -h or --help for help.
